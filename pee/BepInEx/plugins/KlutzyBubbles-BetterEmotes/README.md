# BetterEmotes

## Issues (incompatiblities)

Other emote mods may have inconsistancies and should be the first place to check if something isnt working. They just get updated too much for me to check them manually.

Any other issues feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/KlutzyBubbles/lc-better-emotes/issues/new) or contact me directly via the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC) or PM `@KlutzyBubbles` always trying to make sure the mod is as stable as possible.

## Information

Moving from 1.0.x to 1.1.x changes the config layout.

Modification of https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sligili/More_Emotes/

- Adds controller support. With rebinding :)
- Moves keybindings into the settings page, still has config values for defaults for modpacks
- Makes center of emote wheel not change emote
- Adds config values to alter change emote cooldown and griddy move speed (as of 1.1.0)
- Add config to add option to stop emote when on outer circle of emote wheel
- Remove the carrying scrap check to make emoting with one hand possible again (its fun)

- Any change suggestions or bugs you can submit an issue or contact directly :)

## CUSTOM BINDS ‚öô
### Bindings have moved to the in-game bindings under settings

Enabling/Dsiabling emotes can still be found in the config as well as griddy speed and emote cooldown

## NOTE ON CONTROLLERS!!! IMPORTANT (Probably)

There is a binding in game called 'Emote Wheel CONTROLLER ONLY', this should only ever be bound to right or left stick. Binding it to anything else will just default to right stick. ALSO binding this to a keyboard key will also default it to right stick, if you accidentally bound the key, you will have to delete or edit your keybind file in the config folder and re launch.
